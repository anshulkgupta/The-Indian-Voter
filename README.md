Data scraping project - General Elections India '14


Trying to figure this out.

Revised Objective:

1. Search streaming API for hashtag
2. Check if tweet has geo location data
3. If yes, then push it to mysql database containing tweet handle, message, geolocation data, hashtags used.
4. Export db file and use D3 / CartoDb to map it.

I'm working on file called download_data.py
